FCSH Bash Wrapper
=================

These are two tiny bash scripts to use the flex fcsh utility in text editors like vim, emacs and others.

Usage
=====

Open a terminal window in the directory where the sources of your flex application resides and run the fschw.sh command.

In your favorite editor (or in other terminal window) run fcsend.sh, the arguments are passed directly to the compiler.


VIM Example
===========

    :set makeprg=fcsend.sh\ compile\ $*
    :set errorformat=%f(%l):\ \ Error:\ %m,%-G%.%#
    
to Full compile the current file:

    :!fcsend.sh mxmlc %
    
for incremental compile the current file:
    
    :make n  (n is the target id)
